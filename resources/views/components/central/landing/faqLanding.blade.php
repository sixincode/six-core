            Even small local businesses that only serve their hometown need a site. That's because the web is the first place people go when looking for a product or service. A website helps every business:<br>

          <x-hive-display-faq-item title="{{__('Why do I need a professional email?')}}" >
            There are a lot of reasons to switch from your free email to a domain-based email, but here are the top 3:
          <ol class="list-inside list-decimal">
              <li>Customers are much more likely to trust a professional address like thomas@thomastech.com than thomastech99@gmail.com.</li>
              <li><a href="#" data-track-name="professional-business-email_link" data-track-eid-click="" data-tracked="">Professional Email</a>&nbsp;provides world-class security with industry-leading spam and virus filters.</li>
              <li>Personalized email addresses promote your business more effectively. Every time you send an email, you are giving your web address to customers and prospects, encouraging them to visit your website.</li>
          </ol>

          <x-hive-display-faq-item title="{{__('What is web hosting and do I need it?')}}" >
            Every website takes up space on a physical server somewhere. Web hosting stores those files and makes your siteâ€™s content accessible to people online.

          <x-hive-display-faq-item title="{{__('What type of web hosting do I need?')}}" >
            It all depends on the needs of your site. For beginners and smaller sites, shared hosting is probably just right. For those who need more control, VPS or dedicated hosting is likely a better option.
